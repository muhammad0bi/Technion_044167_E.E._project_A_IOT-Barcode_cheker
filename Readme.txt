Overview
This project is a collaboration with Bnai Zion Medical Center aimed at addressing a critical issue in hospital and medical center laboratories: the mismanagement of patient samples. The goal is to design a reliable and low-cost barcode checker device that ensures patient samples are accurately labeled with a unique barcode, preventing mix-ups and errors during processing.

Problem Definition
Currently, when patient samples are collected, they are labeled with barcode stickers containing important patient information, such as their name and ID number. Upon arrival at the laboratory, staff compare these samples against the patient's details in the computer system. Each sample is typically assigned a label that includes the patient’s name/ID, along with a unique barcode tied to the patient.

Problems arise when multiple samples from the same or different patients arrive simultaneously. Manual handling and labeling can lead to confusion, causing potential sample mix-ups. To prevent these errors, it is essential that samples are accurately identified at every stage, ensuring they belong to the correct patient and are processed in the right laboratory.

Solution
To address these challenges, we have designed a low-cost, reliable barcode checker device that ensures each sample labeled with a patient’s name/ID is matched with the corresponding barcode, known as the "Golden Barcode." This device helps avoid misidentifications and errors throughout the entire process.

Key Features
Accurate Barcode Matching: Ensures that patient samples are correctly labeled with the matching unique barcode.
Low-Cost Design: Designed to be cost-effective for widespread use in hospitals and medical centers.
Arduino-based Solution: The device was successfully designed using an Arduino platform, providing a flexible and easily programmable solution.
Improved Workflow: Minimizes the risk of sample mix-ups and enhances efficiency in laboratory environments.
Development Process
Component Bring-Up: We performed bring-up and testing for each component of the system to ensure they functioned correctly before integration.
Arduino Design: The barcode checker device was designed using Arduino, which allowed for efficient development and testing of the prototype.
Learning and Improvement: After encountering some challenges during the initial stages, we refined our design and suggested a new scheme to improve functionality and performance. This iterative process helped optimize the device for real-world use.
Conclusion
The barcode checker device provides a simple yet effective solution to the problem of mismanagement of patient samples in laboratories. By leveraging affordable components and an Arduino-based design, we have developed a system that ensures patient samples are correctly identified and matched with the proper barcode, reducing the risk of errors and improving laboratory workflows.
