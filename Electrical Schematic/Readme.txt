This directory contains the electrical schematics for our project, organized as follows:

1)Original:
Contains the initial schematic we sent for production.

2)Original_re-wired:
Reflects the updated schematic after making corrections to fix errors discovered during production.
Shows the actual connections present in the project after re-wiring the PCB.

3)Corrected:
Contains the "optimal" schematic, representing the ideal design we should have implemented.
This version incorporates lessons learned from our mistakes, aiming to:
Optimize the structure for efficient code.
Ensure all hardware components have proper connections.
Avoid connection issues while maintaining a compact and effective layout.
we strongly advice to use it if you want to do a smilar project.


Use these schematics as a reference for understanding the design evolution and final implementation of the project's electrical system.
