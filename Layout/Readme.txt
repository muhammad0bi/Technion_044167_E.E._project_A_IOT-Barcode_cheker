This directory contains all relevant files related to the PCB design of the project. It includes PDFs and images describing the layout, component placement, connections, and design details of the PCB.

Key Files:
1)PC0101122A__PC0101122A_TOP.pdf
Illustrates the components located on the top side of the PCB.

2)PC0101122A__PC0101122A_BOTTOM.pdf
Shows the components located on the bottom side of the PCB.

These two files are particularly important as they demonstrate how the PCB design utilizes both sides of the board efficiently.
This ensures full use of the available area,
while maintaining proper access for the user to interact with critical components like the screen, switch, and USB charger.

The PowerPoint file (PCB_Layout.pptx) provides an overview of the intended PCB layout design, which matches the final outcome.
This file showcases the original vision for the PCB and highlights how the achieved design aligns perfectly with the plan.

Other files in the directory, including 3D models (_TOP_3D, _BOTTOM_3D) and perspective views (FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT), offer detailed insights into the PCB structure and component placement.
These files collectively document the evolution and final realization of the project's PCB design.
